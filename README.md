## Why

Building a vimrc file should not be difficult. **You're configuring a code editor that was invented in 1991** after all. No-matter your experience level, there are always new ways to alter your vim experience, yet finding the commands to do so can be impossible as tips are scattered across the internet.

</p>

<br/>

Having a vimrc is nearly critical if it's your primary text editor. Certain things should have just been built in, but they are not.

Example: `syntax on` in your vimrc enables syntax hi-lighting

`syntax on` and many more options are available in the web app.
